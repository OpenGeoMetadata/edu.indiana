    "Indiana Historic Maps provides images of a small portion of maps that focus on Indiana. The majority of this collection focuses on maps produced prior to 1923 unless known to be in the public domain as state or federal documents. In addition, Indiana University Bloomington holds an outstanding collection of print maps by and about geographic areas covering the state of Indiana. Most well known of these are the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps which have been digitized through 1923 and now available at: https://libraries.indiana.edu/union-list-sanborn-maps. In addition we own many maps produced by Indiana State government agencies including state and county highway maps, IGS geologic maps and DNR park maps; U.S. Federal agencies such as the USGS topographic maps, Congressional survey maps and AMS maps from the 1940s; as well as privately produced maps for the state but also cities and counties."
