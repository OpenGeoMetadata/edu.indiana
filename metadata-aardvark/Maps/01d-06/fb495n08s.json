    "One of a series of maps created or annotated by Alfred C. Kinsey. Most contain gall wasp data. Several only contain data on other types of flora and fauna. On this map, data points appear in California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Data points also extend into the Mexican state of Baja California (listed on base map in English as \"Lower California\"). Several data points extend south beyond the printed border of the map to include data from the southernmost portion of the Baja peninsula. Species are listed in Latin (binomial nomenclature) and color coded (see Caption field).",
    "Caption: Var. occidentalis, Var. biseriatus, Var. taylori, Var. Beckii. This map is torn in several places on the bottom edge. One tear obscures the end of a handwritten item, likely a name. The portion still visible reads \"Milo M\".",
