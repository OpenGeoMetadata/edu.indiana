    "One of a series of maps created or annotated by Alfred C. Kinsey. Most contain gall wasp data. Several only contain data on other types of flora and fauna. This map is untitled. The words \"Pinus Ponderosa\" are hand-written in the left-hand margin. Data points appear in Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. Data points extend into the Mexican state of Baja California (listed on base map in English as \"Lower California\") and Western Canada. Some data points extend north beyond the printed border of the map.",
