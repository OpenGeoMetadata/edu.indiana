    "Map created by Alfred C. Kinsey displaying route and data points associated with Kinsey's field research on gall wasps. On this map, data points, marked with black asterisks, appear in Texas and Mexico. Routes appears as a dotted line. No specific species data is listed. In the center-left portion of the map, a print of a hand-drawn gall wasp image, measuring approximately 2\" x 2\", is pasted onto the map surface. The pasted wasp image appears within a hand-drawn polygon, measuring approximately 3.25\" x 3.25\". A second hand-drawn polygon, filled in with black ink and measuring approximately 3\" x 2.25\", appears in the center-right portion of the map.",
    "Caption: The words \"4 col tonite Don McClane\" appear at the bottom center of the map. It is unclear at this time whether the words are related to the map content."
