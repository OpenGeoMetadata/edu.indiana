    "One of a series of maps created or annotated by Alfred C. Kinsey. Most contain gall wasp data. Several only contain data on other types of flora and fauna. On this map, data points appear in Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Data points also extend into the Mexican state of Baja California (listed on base map in English as \"Lower California\") and the Arizona/Mexico border. Species are listed in Latin (binomial nomenclature) and color coded (see Caption field). This map is torn such that the final \"r\" in the title is missing.",
    "Caption: catenifer, heermanni, annectens, stejnegeri, deserticola, rutilus, ?? determination uncertain, possibly deserticola.",
