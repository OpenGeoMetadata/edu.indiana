    "An Atlas of Indiana features over one hundred maps of the state. The maps are chiefly thematic, featuring \"a broad coverage of both natural conditions and human activities on a state-wide basis\" (Kingsbury, page 3). The atlas covers a little of everything: annual precipitation, bedrock geology, population distribution, income, industry, agriculture, and scheduled airline flights. The atlas sources data from the latest federal census materials available in 1968-69."
