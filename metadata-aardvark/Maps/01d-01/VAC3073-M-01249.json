    "By Gerald H. Johnson and Stanley J. Keller. transverse Mercator projection. Regional geologic map , no. 8. Relief shown by profile. Includes columnar sections showing bedrock units accompanied by geological time table, schematic section, geological cross section/profile, index map of published quadrangles, township diagram and 2 diagrams showing areas of primary responsibility. Geology compiled from original data by J. L. Forsyth, F. W. Terwilliger, G. D. Elis, Mark Reshkin, S. J. Keller, and G. H. Johnson. Compilation of bedrock geology coordinated and edited by S. J. Keller and of unconsolidated deposits by G. H. Johnson. Index maps show areas of primary mapping responsibility. Drafted by R. L. Purcell and J. R. Tolen. Issued in cooperation with Michigan State Geological Survey. Based modified from Army Map Service Map NK 16-9, 1962. \"Note: In addition to the complete geologic map of this quadrangle, which shows both bedrock and unconsolidated deposits, separate parts depicting the two main elements of the areal geology are available: Part A shows only bedrock, Part B shows only unconsolidated deposits. The explanation, columnar and cross sections, and marginal information are the same on the separate parts as on the complete map.\"",
